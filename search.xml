        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>This fall term, our CS 449 group consisting of Hongbo Du, Nino Ding, Wenyi Hu, Zuomiao Hu, and Nicole Qian worked on a product named proLearner, an online platform that seeks to enable informal learning while creating a more personalized experience for users with different needs.</p><p>In the modern day and age, people lead busy lives split between their career and family and find it hard to take classes in the traditional way via in-person lectures. As well, while in a traditional classroom setting, people may experience pressure from regularly scheduled assessments and judgment from their fellow students. However, when taking online classes, people find it difficult to form connections with their peers due to the lack of face-to-face interaction. Addressing the issues with classroom style learning while mitigating the shortcomings of online classes will let a more people learn what they want without being held back by the status quo teaching methodologies.</p><p>To accomplish this, proLearner offers online lessons in the form of pre-recorded lectures and slides along with short formative assessments at strategic intervals that the user can use to evaluate their own learning. Furthermore, our platform has a community system that features Q&amp;A forums with course instructors as well as private and group messaging between users.</p><p>Throughout the term, our group gained valuable insight into the different parts of the design process. The following report details each step we took and showcases our final product.</p><h1 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h1><p>Our team began by looking into existing research on the topic of our platform. An article titled “Side Effects of Online: pros and cons in the development of informal online learning’’ helped guide our product design process by outlining high-level problems related to online learning. One critical insight it brought forth was the lack of connection between students while taking online courses which had a negative impact on both their mental health and academic performance. This inspired our team to include a community feature in proLearner that would overcome the major drawback of online learning.</p><p>An online learning platform is not a novel idea, and this can be seen in existing services such as Coursera and Udemy. The existence of such products served as a foundation upon which proLearner was built on. Many standard features of these services such as readily accessible pre-made lecture material and formative quizzes were included in our own product. One aspect that differentiates proLearner from the competition however is the focus on its community system and subsequent features. While Coursera and Udemy possess Q&amp;A chats with course experts, they lack features such as a dedicated user forum that facilitates interaction between peers. This not only helps proLearner gain an edge over the competitors in the market, but also allows it to uniquely address the problem of a lack of connection that comes with online learning.</p><h1 id="Value-Proposition"><a href="#Value-Proposition" class="headerlink" title="Value Proposition"></a>Value Proposition</h1><p>After conducting thorough research and analyzing existing solutions, our team embarked on the empathy stage to better understand our user group’s pain points and desires. Through the value proposition activity, we discovered that our unique selling point is to enhance the benefits of informal learning, which allows users to learn at their own pace in a judgment-free environment. In contrast to a traditional classroom setting, informal learning will enable students to learn without the constraints of a schedule and the social pressure that accompanies in-person learning. Additionally, we identified that some users fear losing track of their learning progress and becoming overwhelmed by the amount of information available.</p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*-ddMUu9bCj3sZm4p" alt=""></p><h1 id="User-Personas-and-Empathy-Maps"><a href="#User-Personas-and-Empathy-Maps" class="headerlink" title="User Personas and Empathy Maps"></a>User Personas and Empathy Maps</h1><p>To better understand our user group, we created personas and empathy maps to represent their needs and motivations. Each of the three personas we have chosen represents a person in a drastically different stage of their life. While all 3 of these personas wish to learn about new topics on our platform, their differing backgrounds mean that each of them has different wants and needs regarding the type of content they are interested in learning and how their associated courses are delivered. When creating our personas, we researched the demographics of current online learning platforms such as Udemy and MasterClass. This allowed us to identify different market segments for our product to focus on.</p><h2 id="Meet-Lucy"><a href="#Meet-Lucy" class="headerlink" title="Meet Lucy"></a>Meet Lucy</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*3Q_RUQ-4kbBdd7vb" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*PRcTZ41Knj-LeSda" alt=""></p><p>Lucy is a 27-year-old working professional with the time and money to pursue hobbies that she may have put aside for her career. She represents the demographic of adults who have been in the workforce for several years and have progressed in their careers. Regarding learning on our platform, Lucy may be interested in courses that can help her advance her career or improve her skills in a hobby. She may prefer classes that are delivered in a structured format and allow for timely communication with the instructor.</p><h2 id="Meet-Kate"><a href="#Meet-Kate" class="headerlink" title="Meet Kate"></a>Meet Kate</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Gsg5SxfFRUpNtzEF" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*aHj4KZtap4Tls0Jr" alt=""></p><p>Kate is a 37-year-old mother of three who represents the demographic of parents who want to enhance their domestic skills. She may be interested in courses on our platform that can help her improve her cooking, cleaning, or parenting skills. As a busy parent, Kate may prefer flexible courses that allow her to learn at her own pace. She may also value affordable courses that can be completed in a short amount of time.</p><h2 id="Meet-Alex"><a href="#Meet-Alex" class="headerlink" title="Meet Alex"></a>Meet Alex</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*atHTAuWQIjCr0UBa" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*4TQgd01AFL1neADT" alt=""></p><p>Alex is a 22-year-old college graduate looking to learn and enhance technical skills for the workplace. He represents individuals just starting their careers and looking for resources to support them. Alex may be interested in courses on our platform that can help him advance practical skills relevant to his field of work and extend his skillsets for his career path. He may prefer concise courses that offer a certificate or recognition upon completion.</p><p>Our research revealed that users generally seek out online learning for its convenience and flexibility, allowing them to learn on their own schedule regardless of their busy lives or learning abilities. Although the purpose of using informal learning by the User Personas differs from hobby to career-focused, a common pain point for many users is the difficulty of finding relevant topics to learn about, which often requires them to spend excessive amounts of time searching for information. This necessitates a recommendation system of sorts on our platform, which bases its suggestions on user-inputted topics of interest.</p><h1 id="Questionnaire-and-User-Interviews"><a href="#Questionnaire-and-User-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="Questionnaire and User Interviews"></a>Questionnaire and User Interviews</h1><p>To gain a deeper understanding of our users’ learning motivations and preferences, our team interviewed a diverse group of people from our network and volunteers we found online. Through this process, we discovered that most interviewees prefer to learn through video lectures rather than live meetings. While they appreciate the personal interaction between students and teachers, they feel more comfortable with a personalized learning pace. This insight allows us to address the common concern among users of losing track during their learning process. In addition, we also received feedback on the overall value of informal learning. Some interviewees were skeptical about the professionalism of our platform and expressed that they would only be willing to pay for the service after a free trial if they were convinced of our platform’s superiority compared to readily available online videos.</p><p>In conclusion, our research and interviews have shown that our user group values the flexibility and autonomy of informal learning but is concerned about staying on track and finding relevant topics to learn about. To address these pain points, our platform will offer a recommendation system based on user-specified interests and free trials to help users decide if our platform is a good fit for their learning needs.</p><h1 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h1><p>After our team identified the problems facing proLearner, we started brainstorming ideas and features we could introduce to solve these problems. A Miro board with all of the different individual and grouped ideas was made, and a vote was held to determine the key features to be included in the prototype.</p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*gvp7fY3imlC_dF-K" alt=""></p><p>Among all of the options, we settled on the following five features.</p><ol><li>A recommendation system where we can take the user-inputted area of<br>interest and return courses based on the aforementioned topics.</li><li>A formative evaluation feature consisting of practice problem sets and<br>optional project ideas would allow users to evaluate their learning.</li><li>An anonymous community feature that allows people to register for<br>courses and ask questions in any community anonymously.</li><li>A community feature allows people taking the same courses to connect<br>and chat with each other.</li><li>A Q&amp;A system to achieve real-time and asynchronous communication<br>between course instructors and students.</li></ol><h2 id="Storyboards"><a href="#Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="Storyboards"></a>Storyboards</h2><p>Our team then created storyboards to represent user stories associated with these features to gather more insights about user needs, how our product can solve their dilemma, and how we can refine key features.</p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*H85yhOzzWlr15-OPzkUEXw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ntQN2SRTH4Ku9Y2R" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bOjmRP1k19p3CdsV" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*zMDSu44KVi1X-ED4" alt=""></p><h2 id="User-Flows"><a href="#User-Flows" class="headerlink" title="User Flows"></a>User Flows</h2><p>After gathering more insights into user problems and how the five features can help solve them, our team created basic user flows and outlined wireframes for each design argument. After deciding the basic outline of our design, we chose the two most important features of our app to continue elaborating on.</p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*D_7BgGCLUN54lI66" alt=""></p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*TTyom5QzMW643vKH" alt=""></p><p>Our team chose to prototype the community user flow and the Q&amp;A user flow since we thought that these two features were the key differentiators of our app from other existing solutions. During our empathy stage, we noticed that a lot of users’ concerns are related to losing connections with other peers and not being able to ask questions in a timely manner. While existing solutions offer features such as a recommendation system, most do not include a community and Q&amp;A feature.</p><p>Based on this activity, our team was able to better understand which layout is needed for the feature. We used insights collected from user storyboards and user flow to figure out what the user would want to see and use at different stages of the user flow. As we decided our screen layout and branding guideline, we kept in mind design principles such as consistency and affordance. For example, we tried to figure out why the user would be confused and why they would want to click the wrong button. To keep our design closer to other traditional UX flows, we checked the fonts of most iOS apps and borrowed ideas from other apps such as Reddit and Piazza for the community feature. The primary and secondary colors we chose are purple and light pinkish purple which are associated with creativity and wisdom. Throughout the design, our team aimed to create a straightforward user flow where people can reach out for questions and connect with other peers easily and quickly.</p><h1 id="Final-Design"><a href="#Final-Design" class="headerlink" title="Final Design"></a>Final Design</h1><h1 id="Low-Fidelity-Prototypes-Evaluation"><a href="#Low-Fidelity-Prototypes-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Low-Fidelity Prototypes Evaluation"></a>Low-Fidelity Prototypes Evaluation</h1><h2 id="Paper-Prototype"><a href="#Paper-Prototype" class="headerlink" title="Paper Prototype"></a>Paper Prototype</h2><p>To evaluate our low-fidelity paper prototype, we asked participants to complete a series of tasks while we took notes about their confusion and hesitation and observe their reactions. In the original wireframe prototype, the overall user flow for the community feature was smooth, but there was some hesitation during the process. Firstly, users were not sure about the difference between signing in anonymously versus with an account. Secondly, they wanted to be able to sort posts according to the most upvotes while they were exploring the community feature. Thirdly, users wanted to have a way to preview posts that they were about to create before posting them. To solve these issues, our team added these functionalities in their respective pages. In addition, we changed the anonymous feature to “continue as guests” in order to simplify its function and make it more accessible and familiar to users.</p><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*h3R-g9Hjdar6s2KNUt40Sg.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="Wireframe-Prototype"><a href="#Wireframe-Prototype" class="headerlink" title="Wireframe Prototype"></a>Wireframe Prototype</h2><p>In our team’s original low-fidelity wireframe prototype, the Q&amp;A system worked as a real-time communication feature, which meant that students had to wait until an instructor came online to answer them. The participants wanted a way to find instant answers when the instructors were unavailable in an asynchronous manner. Thus, we added a “Common Questions” section under the Q&amp;A feature, allowing our students to find useful resources before needing to inquire further. The “Common Question List” includes common questions that previous students asked about the current lectures, which are collected, and summarized by the instructor. On the “Common Question Page”, the instructor could post potential answer keys consisting of text, pictures, or videos. To emphasize the unique points of our Q&amp;A system, we added a status symbol and a local time on the “Ask Instructor” page. This way, users can easily estimate if they are able to receive an instantaneous response and whether or not it would be more effective to browse existing answers to common questions.</p><h1 id="Original"><a href="#Original" class="headerlink" title="Original"></a>Original</h1><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*PpR3eLz9tZnXkcyx" alt=""></p><h1 id="Updated"><a href="#Updated" class="headerlink" title="Updated"></a>Updated</h1><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*A6I2GAjeB8mQtAEd" alt=""></p><h1 id="High-Fidelity-Prototype-Heuristic-Evaluations"><a href="#High-Fidelity-Prototype-Heuristic-Evaluations" class="headerlink" title="High-Fidelity Prototype Heuristic Evaluations"></a>High-Fidelity Prototype Heuristic Evaluations</h1><p>Two groups from our class completed our high-fidelity prototype heuristic evaluations. They pointed out limitations in the original high-fidelity prototype from perspectives of “Consistency and Standards”, “Aesthetic and Minimalist Design”, and “User Control and Freedom”*. *A group said they<br>couldn’t tell if the preview button was activated since it’s not immediately clear that clicking the preview button will exit the preview. There was also a misalignment among rectangles on the community page and the visual for selecting “Community” was inconsistent. “My Courses” and “Home” were filled in with purple, but “Community” had a shadow effect. Another group indicated that the bump on the selected icon in the navigation menu did not align with “Aesthetic and Minimalist Design” since it took up excessive screen space (filled purple icon indicates selection). Moreover, the number of points corresponding to a post by a user disappeared when viewing the post.</p><h1 id="Resulting-Design-Iteration"><a href="#Resulting-Design-Iteration" class="headerlink" title="Resulting Design Iteration"></a>Resulting Design Iteration</h1><p>Based on the findings from the heuristic evaluations above, our team made the following updates. To make our prototype consistent, we looked at all the pages and adjusted any misalignments, mispositions, and missing elements. To distinguish the activation status of previewing a button and to highlight its uniqueness, we created a separate preview page instead of simply adding an on or off status. When a user clicks preview, they will be taken to this page and can exit the preview by clicking the back button. A user can also edit the post on the preview page after clicking the newly added “Edit” button. We removed the bump on the selected navigation icon and made the community icon fill with purple upon being selected. In addition to addressing all the issues from the evaluations, our team made our prototype more professional in accordance with iOS UX design conventions by adding common widgets such as the horizontal bar at the bottom of the screens and using the default iOS keyboard layout. To further complete the user flow, we added pages to illustrate the effects of clicking photo gallery on view post and a textbox incorporating the selected image.</p><h1 id="Original-High-Fidelity-Prototype"><a href="#Original-High-Fidelity-Prototype" class="headerlink" title="Original High-Fidelity Prototype"></a>Original High-Fidelity Prototype</h1><h2 id="Q-amp-A-Feature"><a href="#Q-amp-A-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A Feature"></a>Q&amp;A Feature</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RKzPR-B1WuZ4j-Vx" alt=""></p><h2 id="Community-Feature"><a href="#Community-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Community Feature"></a>Community Feature</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6K29azhLDyb64js7" alt=""></p><h1 id="Updated-High-Fidelity-Prototype"><a href="#Updated-High-Fidelity-Prototype" class="headerlink" title="Updated High-Fidelity Prototype"></a>Updated High-Fidelity Prototype</h1><h2 id="Q-amp-A-Feature-1"><a href="#Q-amp-A-Feature-1" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A Feature"></a>Q&amp;A Feature</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*c1azzhNySkBf73wV" alt=""></p><h2 id="Community-Feature-1"><a href="#Community-Feature-1" class="headerlink" title="Community Feature"></a>Community Feature</h2><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vIxHv3Al6pnXQZlNeIjjIw.png" alt=""></p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>In the design process of our product proLearner, there were several insights our team gained with regards to UX design. One of these insights was with regards to consistency of elements in our platform pages. In our original wireframe prototypes, the only commonalities between each page were the color scheme and icons. As a result, there was a disconnect in the user’s experience when they traversed proLearner’s various features. This is because although the core components of the prototype were consistent throughout, small differences in each page’s layout, font, and spacing reduced its overall clarity and usability. Upon revising our high-fidelity prototype, we created a detailed template for each page that was followed instead of being left up to each group member’s personal discretion. This resulted in a product that appeared as if it was made by the same person in one sitting and was much easier to interact with. Reflecting on this experience highlights the utmost importance of establishing detailed design specifications in the planning process of a prototype which proved essential in proLearner’s development and can be applied to the design of any other UX.</p><p>Another insight our group found was in the importance of drawing upon existing UX design standards specifically as it pertains to which platform the user will be interacting with the product on. The original wireframe prototype of proLearner had pages that were based on a generic interface design without regard to whether the user was an iOS, Android or web user. As a result, there were few elements in the prototype that were based on existing symbols that the user was most likely already familiar with; thus, reducing its overall accessibility and ease of use. In our revised high-fidelity prototype, our group made sure to establish that it was designed for iOS devices and as such, included common attributes of iOS apps such as status symbols on the top left and right and a home bar on the bottom. Furthermore, we chose to use fonts in our prototype that were common to iOS apps such as SF Pro as well as popular iOS icons such as the standard back and home button. This allowed the user to easily infer functionalities of buttons within proLearner and provided them a smooth and comforting experience. Our experience provides an important lesson for UX designers which is to keep in mind the device or platform the user will be interacting with their product on and use existing elements from that platform to enhance ease of use and familiarity.</p><p>In the development process of proLearner, our team focused primarily on its interface and core functionality while largely ignoring the feasibility of implementing its features. If proLearner were to be developed further, implementation of its various systems would need to be considered before deciding on their inclusion. Given the opportunity to continue working on proLearner, our team would need to begin coding its planned features during a preliminary stage in order to determine whether or not said feature should be included in the final design. In addition, it would benefit our UX design if additional rounds of heuristic evaluations were conducted in order to further refine proLearner’s interface.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4 id="A-Picture-with-Eason-Chan"><a href="#A-Picture-with-Eason-Chan" class="headerlink" title="A Picture with Eason Chan"></a>A Picture with Eason Chan</h4><p>Eight years ago, I met Eason Chan(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eason_Chan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">陳奕迅</a>), one of my favourite singers, in a fundraising event. He has been one of China’s best-selling artists every year since 2000 and has won many prestigious awards. His world tours have included performances at The Royal Albert Hall, and he was the first Chinese artist to play at London’s O2 Arena. I grew up listening to his songs and was very excited when I met him. He was so nice, and I was lucky enough that he invited my friend and me to take a picture with him. That day was one of my best days, but the only thing that makes it imperfect is that the picture we took was pretty blurry since my friend’s phone camera was in low resolution. Also, I was never fortunate enough to meet him again. I have saved the picture for eight years now and always wish to find a way to recover it for higher quality.</p><h4 id="GFP-GAN"><a href="#GFP-GAN" class="headerlink" title="GFP-GAN"></a>GFP-GAN</h4><p>I recently read a Linkedin post from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/murilo-gustineli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murilo Gustineli</a> about restoring images using GFP-GAN, a blind face restoration algorithm for real-world low-quality face images. It leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pre-trained face Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). According to the paper, the algorithm aims at recovering high-quality faces from the low-quality counterparts suffering from unknown degradation, such as low-resolution, noise, blur, compression artifacts, etc.</p><p>As a software engineering student specializing in Human-Computer interaction, I believe this algorithm is significant and applicable to people who want to restore their low-quality family pictures or historical pictures that are aged, and it is also meaningful to me. I was very interested in learning about this algorithm and was able to run my picture with Eason through this algorithm. The image on the left is the original picture, and the image on the right is the output. I was surprised by the output image, which has quite impressive details, and I am so thankful for this tool!</p><h5 id="Restored-Image"><a href="#Restored-Image" class="headerlink" title="Restored Image"></a>Restored Image</h5><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/17/Xvxm2E8SHY5y6oO.png" alt="EasonChen.png"></p><p>If you would like to learn more about GFP-GAN, please check the link below.</p><p>💻 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲:<br><a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN</a></p><p>📝 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿:<br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04061.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04061.pdf</a></p>]]></content>

The crowdedness of a location is reflected by the number of unique MAC addresses present, which is obtained by monitoring the packets that Wi-Fi devices transmit in the IEEE 802.11 data link layer.</p><h3 id="Background-Research"><a href="#Background-Research" class="headerlink" title="Background Research"></a>Background Research</h3><p>Research shows that every Wi-Fi device, when probing for available networks, will unavoidably expose its MAC Address, the unique identifier of network devices, in the data link layer, which can be probed by specialized devices easily [1]. In this way, the MAC addresses of Wi-Fi devices within the range of the probe can be obtained even without the devices themselves being connected to any network, making it an ideal measurement of crowdedness.</p><p>To address the privacy issue this may cause, many manufacturers have introduced a technique called MAC Randomization, which allows devices to use a randomized MAC address. However, these randomly generated MAC addresses will have the universal/local bit set to 1 and can be easily distinguished and excluded.</p><h3 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h3><p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FNP0f--PXtr7LRDOGqgsm-WaVfkQol_FJT-hooiSFH3Pqp1zeMBD4H3lDszoioKvDoX-aixsCVlfb4siXLpXOMo6a9VyWsvOxdNnZfOZWRugyWhca3uzrq25FAAm6iwfvJV438aDKxRBJj-GSrK2Bw" alt=""></p><p>Figure 1.

This is calculated by the formula below:</p><p><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=c%20%3D%20%5Ctext%7Bmin%7D(%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D(%5Cfrac%7Bd-l%7D%7Bh-l%7D%2C%200)%2C%20100)%5Ccdot%20100%5C%25%0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3cD-LTJB80ZcQpQlYWKPEOtCMTBOWELP2f0Vafwng-KMbjYA1xuR-QXsYovTiSvkNsvy-CeORRa6xZZ77WNBlEzx0Xn6Qd4Mt9OWV2etKpS1-b5fVaLGeVqqOus32-vmLf-20pUIs-oErQ-vsMdgWg" alt=""></a></p><p>where c is the crowdedness value, d is the current number of unique MAC addresses, h is the 95th-percentile of all historical numbers of MAC addresses and l is the 5th-percentile to avoid the influence of extreme points and outliers.</p><p>Clustering:</p><p>The K-means algorithm from Sklearn is used to aggregate and summarize hourly crowdedness every day. Preprocessed historical data, inputted into the K-means algorithm, can generate a prediction of the crowdedness of every hour of every weekday (Sunday, Monday, etc.).</p><p>ML algorithm (Lightgbm):</p><p>Lightgbm is a powerful tree-based model that can automatically rank the importance of input features. The most difficult part of applying Lightgbm is finding the optimal features. The most important feature for this Time Series problem is the “time” feature. Also, based on the result of the clustering algorithm, it is discovered that the weekday also influences the crowdedness and thereby is chosen to be used as one of the features. Additionally, hours and minutes are also used as features and are used as sparse matrix.</p><h3 id="Group-members’-contribution"><a href="#Group-members’-contribution" class="headerlink" title="Group members’ contribution"></a>Group members’ contribution</h3><p>Zuomiao (Zona) Hu:</p><p>Responsible for the project proposal, implementation of backend features such as time localization and input sanitization, report writing and bug fixes.</p><p>Zuoqiu (Robert) Liu</p><p>Responsible for designing and implementing the Machine Learning models as well as data analysis.</p><p>Song (Tony) Sheng</p><p>Assisted in backend development including data acquisition and organization.

A short interval leads to more accurate predictions but are more energy-consuming. A longer interval, on the contrary, consumes less energy yet produces less real-time results. The finalized version of the device adapts a 5-minute scanning interval which was experimentally determined to ensure maximum possible energy efficiency while hardly compromising real-time accuracy.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that there might exist a strong positive correlation between the number of probing devices employed and the accuracy of the data collected. Since each detector has a limited range, a considerable number of devices have to be installed to eliminate blind areas in an ideal situation. This, however, is not practical given the immense cost and labour required to implement such a large-scale probing network. As a result, only two units are installed, one of which are placed in Davis Centre Library and the other in Dana Porter. The units are installed in typical study area so that the overall crowdedness can be estimated, assuming that people are distributed uniformly.</p><h3 id="Future-Work"><a href="#Future-Work" class="headerlink" title="Future Work"></a>Future Work</h3><p>This project can be further improved by adding more probing stations in different locations to achieve better coverage. More devices installed on each floor can also provide a more accurate result. </p><p>Another thing worth trying is the integration of a noise detector into the devices, which is a potentially good source of detecting crowdedness. </p><p>Furthermore, accuracy might also be enhanced by users’ real-time feedback. It will be more helpful if the website had a section for user comments.</p><p>The prediction algorithm might be further improved by applying Deep Learning.</p><p>On the other hand, the development of mobile apps on Android and iOS platforms can make access to the app easier. </p><h3 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h3><p>[1] J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><font size=4>我的大一在covid-19的突袭下已经匆匆结束了一段时间了。回首过去的一年，滑铁卢带给我了很大的成长。曾经是个高三学生的我和很多人一样怀揣着梦想接了滑铁卢的offer，却不太明白将来会面对什么。SE专业的学生不多，中国国际生也是特别少的，当年在我做关于大学和专业的research时，也鲜有看到SE在读学生的经验总结或是感想，更不用说是中文版的了。因此，我决定写下这篇文章来总结我过去的一年，希望能给未来想来SE或者是滑铁卢就读的学弟学妹们带带路。</font></p><h2 id="学习工作篇"><a href="#学习工作篇" class="headerlink" title="学习工作篇"></a>学习工作篇</h2><h3 id="关于滑铁卢大学-University-of-Waterloo"><a href="#关于滑铁卢大学-University-of-Waterloo" class="headerlink" title="关于滑铁卢大学 (University of Waterloo)"></a>关于滑铁卢大学 (University of Waterloo)</h3><p>滑铁卢大学历史不算悠久。相比于同样在加拿大却更加闻名于世界的多伦多大学，UBC，和McGill，滑铁卢大学是一所年轻有活力的大学。滑大被称作是最受雇主欢迎的学校，也被麦考林杂志(Maclean’s)誉为加拿大最具创新性的大学（Canada’s most innovative university）。</p><blockquote><p>滑铁卢大学的数学，计算机科学和工程学科教学水平居世界前列,学校的代表队曾多次获得ACM 国际大学生程序设计竞赛的冠军。学校有很高的声誉，特别是做为北美地区第一个经认可建立数学系的大学，滑铁卢大学设有北美唯一一所数学院，这也是全世界最大的数学和计算机的教育及研究中心。</p></blockquote><p>可是，我们也得承认因为滑大的“偏科”，它的世界排名没有其他几所历史悠久的学校高（滑铁卢没有医学院）。我知道因为学校的国际声誉度/国内认可度，很多学生担心对找工作有影响，可能在选择offer时纠结滑大还是多大（毕竟当年我就是……），那么希望我接下来的文章可以帮助你更好的了解滑铁卢大学、做出最适合你的选择～（声明一下～这里笔者没有踩一捧一的意思，多大很优秀，我只是被多大学费实力劝退的……【捂脸～】）</p><h4 id="图书馆"><a href="#图书馆" class="headerlink" title="图书馆"></a>图书馆</h4><p>学校有两个图书馆——DC (Davis Centre) 和DP (Dana Porter )。学校的学习氛围是很浓厚的，几乎每个滑铁卢大学的学生都在DC和DP自习过。每到期末的时候，DC是24小时全天开放的，并且很难找到空位。可以通过<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/services/study-rooms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">学校网站</a>预定自习室。</p><p>下图中的是连接了MC和DC的长廊，在寒冷的冬天走着这条路是很好的选择，毕竟谁也不想在雪堆里行走。长廊背后的就是数学系经常上课的地方（M3）。<br><img src=

title="诺贝尔物理奖"></a>诺贝尔物理奖</h4><p>尽管滑大以数学、工程系闻名，它的物理系其实也是很不错的。2018年，滑铁卢大学物理系女教授Donna Strickland成为55年来第一位获得诺贝尔奖物理学奖的女性，也是历史上第三位获得诺贝尔奖物理学奖的女性（第一位获得诺贝尔物理学奖的女性就是1903年鼎鼎有名的Marie Curie）。</p><blockquote><p>滑铁卢大学因此成为加拿大第一个综合类加拿大大学里有教授获得诺贝尔奖的大学。</p></blockquote><p>学校可骄傲了，一直到现在（2020年）还在教学楼张贴着教授的海报，哈哈。</p><p>下图为学校物理教学楼上的天文观测台：<br><img src= "/img/loading.gif"

title="大鹅"></a>大鹅</h4><p>提起滑铁卢，就不得不提起校园内校霸——鹅大爷们。暖和的季节可以在校园的各个角落看到它们成群结队、大摇大摆地穿行，那番场景也可谓是别开生面。不过在这里提醒一下大家不要轻易的招惹他们哈，他们虽然看起来呆萌，攻击力可是很强的。<br><img src= "/img/loading.gif"

Engineering专业"></a>关于Software Engineering专业</h3><p>前面介绍了这么多，终于要进入正题啦。SE号称是加拿大最难进的大学专业之一。记忆中近几年滑大的录取分数线，工程系基本是95分，cs基本上在95-97分且录取率不到5%，而软件工程专业的平均分数线比cs还略高。官网上显示，即使分数到达了95+，录取率也只有40%。对于国际学生而言，录取难度则会更高。由此可见，SE是有多火爆了。</p><blockquote><p>“SE=CS+Engineering, 它比CS更加注重实用，比CE有更多的软件方面的课程。”</p></blockquote><h4 id="2024届1A合影"><a href="#2024届1A合影" class="headerlink" title="2024届1A合影"></a>2024届1A合影</h4><p>今年我们全系大概有127人，其中女生只有将近30名。不过学校挺重视我们女生哒，有<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiE</a>和<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiCS</a>经常组织活动。</p><p>这是我们在1A考完最后一场final后在E7门前合的影，有同学特意带上了orientation发的粉领带，也是很可爱啦。<br><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/26/qOcgIl5JY87sZNG.jpg" alt="1A合影.jpeg"> </p><h4 id="SE的课业压力"><a href="#SE的课业压力" class="headerlink" title="SE的课业压力"></a>SE的课业压力</h4><p>关于SE专业的毕业学分要求和选修课可以查看<a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Software-Engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SE Degree Requirements</a>。下面是SE的 1A&amp;1B必修课介绍。<br><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/26/X1I5FmReVqitkgZ.jpg" alt="WechatIMG1399.jpeg"></p><ul><li><p>MATH 135是一门关于数学逻辑的课。课程难度不大，导师都是数学系的。有幸的话还能分在CEMC负责人（就是主要负责给Euclid contest出题的老师）的班里。每周都会有作业，好好写就行。</p></li><li><p>CS 137和138对于SE有编程基础的同学来说没有太大难度，基本上每周/隔周完成assignments即可。</p></li><li><p>MATH 117和MATH 119和高中学习的微积分内容很像，也是按时完成作业、复习参加quiz就没什么问题。</p></li><li><p>ECE 105，ECE 106，ECE 124和ECE 140都会有lab，需要投入很多时间做lab/写lab report。经历了日复一日在MC1085的上课，你就会觉得能够到其它教学楼参加这些lab还是挺有意思的。自己动手、学习使用各种软件，对于加深对课程内容的理解会有很大的帮助。</p></li><li><p>MATH 115是线性代数，虽然上的也比较基础，可苦了我这个BC上高中的孩子了。几乎所有课程内容高中都没有接触过，当时我们的老师是第一次教课，逻辑比较跳跃，板书也很像天书。我几乎是全靠Khan Academy和隔壁班老师的notes学习下来的。每周有quiz，得好好准备哈。</p></li><li><p>SE 101会要求大家组队结合软硬件做个<br>project, 会在课余时间比较费时。当时我们组做的是一个能在公共区域检测拥挤度的<a href="https://github.com/ZonaHu/crowdedness-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crowdedness Monitor</a>。</p></li><li><p>SE 102就是Seminar了，有时候会请Speaker来给大家讲讲找工作/面试的经验。</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> SE 2024届 1A  term的 Final 成绩中位数是<em>84.182</em></p></blockquote><h5 id="课表"><a href="#课表" class="headerlink" title="课表"></a>课表</h5><p>下面是我1A和1B时的两张课表给大家参考。相比于课表更满的ECE，SE的课业压力其实并没有那么重。看上去课表比较满也是因为Lab和tutorial比较多。</p><h6 id="1A"><a href="#1A" class="headerlink" title="1A"></a>1A</h6><p><img src=

可能不同的人感受到的难度也是不大一样的</p><ul><li><p>1A：ECE 105 &gt; &gt; CS 137 &gt; MATH 115 &gt; MATH 117 &gt; MATH 135 &gt; SE 101</p></li><li><p>1B: ECE 106 &gt;&gt; ECE 124 &gt; MATH 119 = ECE 140 (CS138给我的感觉比CS137简单一些，难度取决于你的编程水平)</p></li></ul><p>ECE 105和106对我而言是最难的，不过也有很多喜欢物理的大佬觉得轻轻松松。总而言之，学习没有捷径，还是需要多练习。建议合理进行时间规划，按时完成老师布置的problem sets，最后就不会有太大压力啦。 </p><h4 id="推荐一些资源"><a href="#推荐一些资源"

title="学校社团及活动"></a>学校社团及活动</h3><p>学校不同的院系经常会给学生发邮件组织各类活动。在刚开学的时候，学校会有个社团招新活动，工程系在E7也有自己Design Team的展示。到时候大家可以根据自己的兴趣爱好加入各种社团和design team！<br><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/26/oaTpsRAUNtK5BPi.jpg" alt="社团活动.jpeg"></p><p>我在1B的时候参加了学校的一个autonomous vehicle design team叫<a href="https://www.watonomous.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WATonomous</a>，基本上每周会有一个meeting和5-6小时的work load。参加这类design team挺需要投入时间的，但同时也可以接触到自己感兴趣的领域并且认识一些人，我认为还是很值得的。<br><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/26/cDW3URnYkor41Kh.jpg" alt="watonomous-min.JPG"></p><h3 id="实习-Coop"><a href="#实习-Coop" class="headerlink" title="实习 (Coop)"></a>实习 (Coop)</h3><p>很多人选择滑大都是因为它的Coop项目。官网数据显示，SE学生平均每个Co-op term可以有$13,300 的收入。学校有专门的平台<em>WaterlooWorks</em>提供许多岗位供你申请，之后会经历interview，互相rank等环节。如果你成功的match了，那么恭喜你找到一份工作啦！Co-op的地点并不局限于加拿大，你甚至还可以在平台上申请到德国、日本、韩国、中国、美国等地的工作机会。对我而言，6个不同的为期4个月的Co-op term是一个给自己探索不同兴趣的机会，能够去很多不同的地方也让人很兴奋。值得一提的是，因为Covid-19，一些实习机会也受到了影响。我的第一个Co-op term是远程实习度过的，也是一段难忘的经历了呢。</p><p>相关信息：<a
